    <h1 style="font-size:30px; font-family:Verdana; color:#8B0000; text-align:center"> About </h1>
    <p style="font-size:15px;font-family:Garamond;color:black, text-align:left"> "Baiciu Pirtis" was established in September of 2002 and successfully operates for 12 years already. We are very dedicated to make your stay as pleasant as possible and thus we invite you to experience the wonders of sauna. Enjoy this haven where you relax your mind, renew your body and refresh your spirit. </p>
    <h2 style="font-size:25px; font-family:Verdana; color:#8B0000; text-align:center"> Services </h2>
    <p style="font-size:15px;font-family:Garamond;color:black, text-align:left"> 
There are two saunas: one is smaller and fits up to 12 people while the second is bigger and fits up to 25 people. </p>
    <h2 style="font-size:20px; font-family:Verdana; color:#8B0000; text-align:center"> Sauna Benefits </h2> 
    <ul>
			<li><p style="color:#F4A460">Soothes and relaxes tired muscles</p></li>
	<p style="font-size:15px;font-family:Garamond;color:black, text-align:left">
	Athletes use Saunas to improve their range of motion and to help loosen tight muscles after a hard workout. </p>
	       <li><p style="color:#F4A460">Helps to relieve mental fatigue</p></li>
	<p style="font-size:15px;font-family:Garamond;color:black, text-align:left">
	When your body is relaxed your mind feels better and you feel better. The Sauna promotes a wonderful sense of well being. </p>  
	       <li><p style="color:#F4A460">Improves circulation</p></li>
	<p style="font-size:15px;font-family:Garamond;color:black, text-align:left">
	Blood vessel dilation brings blood closer to the surface of the skin and, as blood vessels expand to accommodate increased blood flow, circulation in the extremities improves. </p> 
	       <li><p style="color:#F4A460">Burn as many as 300 calories during a Sauna session</p></li>
	<p style="font-size:15px;font-family:Garamond;color:black, text-align:left">
	The Sauna should not, of course, be used as a weight loss aid by itself, but when used with a good diet and exercise program, a Sauna can help burn more calories. Weight is lost in a Sauna, but most of it is water loss from sweating. </p> 
	   <li><p style="color:#F4A460">Sweat out toxins and impurities from the body</p></li>
	<p style="font-size:15px;font-family:Garamond;color:black, text-align:left">
	Sauna is the deepest cleaning bath in the world. Perspiration induced by a Sauna opens the body's pores and naturally expels impurities and toxins from the body. There are many detoxification programs that use the Sauna daily to rid the body of chemicals. The Sauna has been used to sweat out nicotine, pesticides, and other toxins. Skin is the largest organ of the body and 30% of body wastes exit through the skin. The Sauna elevates the body's ability to rid itself of this waste. </p>
