    <p style="font-size:18px;font-family:Garamond;color:black, text-align:left"> 
	There are two saunas: one is <a href="https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/10421533_1699331540293634_1622114868461243159_n.jpg?oh=d6f7e8d5a9c9c7af6e3cec8043c67a4a&oe=558AF94E&__gda__=1435716209_332e08b86de384f7076fd5f4b90801d1"> <span> smaller </span> </a>
	and fits up to 12 people while the second is <a href="https://scontent-bru.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/10898064_1699325436960911_2296915040833476199_n.jpg?oh=2cd10658544cdce68714da3458669995&oe=55489DCA"> <span> bigger </span> </a> and fits up to 25 people. </p>
	<p style="font-size:18px;font-family:Garamond;color:black, text-align:left"> In both saunas, there is a small swimming pool, showers, changing room, and toilet. In a resting area, there is fireplace that creates warm and cosy atmosphere. 
	You can also prepare some food in it if you wish so. There is also a table, some comfortable branches, all the necessary dishes and tableware, a fridge, and a radio. </p>
	<p style="font-size:18px;font-family:Garamond;color:black;text-align:left"> Our saunas are not only meant for bathing but can also be a great place to celebrate events that are important to you: Birthdays, Christmas, small weddings or bridal-showers.
	If you decide to celebrate something, we will make sure that the place looks nice and festive so that you do not need to worry about details but just relax and enjoy yourself. </P>
	<p style="font-size:18px;font-family:Garamond;color:black;text-align:left"> In case you want to stay overnight, we will provide you and your guests with rooms and beds with clean beddings. </p>
	<p style="font-size:18px;font-family:Garamond;color:black;text-align:left"> If you come to us with a family, do not hesitate and bring your children as well. Even if they do not like saunas,
	they will definitely enjoy themselves running around in our big territory, playing table tennis or basketball, swinging on the swing, or swimming in our big pod. </p>
	
	<p style="font-size:24px;font-family:Garamond;color:black;font-weight:bold;text-align:center"> Come and spend an amazing time in relaxing natural surrounding â€“ we are looking forward to greeting you 
and making your time well spent! </p>
	<h2 style="font-size:20px; font-family:Papyrus, fantasy; color:#8B0000; text-align:center"> Sauna Benefits </h2> 
    <ul>
			<li><p style="color:#F4A460;font-weight:bold;">Soothes and relaxes tired muscles</p></li>
	<p style="font-size:18px;font-family:Garamond;color:black, text-align:left">
	Athletes use Saunas to improve their range of motion and to help loosen tight muscles after a hard workout. </p>
	       <li><p style="color:#F4A460;font-weight:bold;">Helps to relieve mental fatigue</p></li>
	<p style="font-size:18px;font-family:Garamond;color:black, text-align:left">
	When your body is relaxed your mind feels better and you feel better. The Sauna promotes a wonderful sense of well being. </p>  
	       <li><p style="color:#F4A460;font-weight:bold;"">Improves circulation</p></li>
	<p style="font-size:18px;font-family:Garamond;color:black, text-align:left">
	Blood vessel dilation brings blood closer to the surface of the skin and, as blood vessels expand to accommodate increased blood flow, circulation in the extremities improves. </p> 
	       <li><p style="font-weight:bold;font-color:#F4A460">Burn as many as 300 calories during a Sauna session</p></li>
	<p style="font-size:18px;font-family:Garamond;color:black, text-align:left">
	The Sauna should not, of course, be used as a weight loss aid by itself, but when used with a good diet and exercise program, a Sauna can help burn more calories. Weight is lost in a Sauna, but most of it is water loss from sweating. </p> 
	   <li><p style="color:#F4A460;font-weight:bold;">Sweat out toxins and impurities from the body</p></li>
	<p style="font-size:18px;font-family:Garamond;color:black, text-align:left">
	Sauna is the deepest cleaning bath in the world. Perspiration induced by a Sauna opens the body's pores and naturally expels impurities and toxins from the body. There are many detoxification programs that use the Sauna daily to rid the body of chemicals. The Sauna has been used to sweat out nicotine, pesticides, and other toxins. Skin is the largest organ of the body and 30% of body wastes exit through the skin. The Sauna elevates the body's ability to rid itself of this waste. </p>
